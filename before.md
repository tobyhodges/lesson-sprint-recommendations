# Before the Sprint

- **Establish an organising committee.** Organising the sprint will be much easier if there are multiple people involved in planning and running the event.
  Aim to establish an organising committee with members from diverse backgrounds who can bring a broad perspective to create an accessible and inclusive event for your participants.
  If you have more than 2 people, be sure to assign roles and responsibilities to avoid diffusion of responsibility.
  
- **Select a code of conduct.** If your lesson repository already has a code of conduct,
  apply it to the sprint and associated events too.
  If your lesson repository does not already have a code of conduct, add one.
  Like licenses, we do not recommend that you write your own code of conduct from scratch.
  Instead, re-use/adapt an existing text you find online.
  We recommend [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html),
  which was designed with exactly these kinds of project in mind.
  Assign at least one person as the contact person/facilitator for
  matters relating to the Code of Conduct,
  and make sure all sprint participants are aware of who this is and how they should connect with them.
  You can do this by including their details in the "primer" information
  you provide to participants before the event
  and by introducing them when you mention the code of conduct
  at the start of the sprint itself.
  
- **Set up a planning meeting/call for the committee** Use this meeting to agree on the dates, event format and
  the target audience in sufficient detail and high-level objectives of your sprint.
  Document your discussions and plans in a central location so that everyone involved in the process can access them.
  Divide responsibilities to put together resources (such as for communication and norms) that will be shared with all participants. (See below for more details.)
  
- **Establish communication channels and norms.** This will set an expectation for how collaborators will communicate before, during, and after the sprint.
    - Dedicated messaging channels have been used with success for conversations/short updates during the sprint and in-between sprint conversations.
    See [During the Sprint](/during.md) for more details.
    - Mailing lists for initial organisation and other important and more permanent communication, e.g. scheduling meetings.
    - **[Online]** Video conferencing technology that is an accessible choice for everyone and suitable for the format of the sprint.
    - Decide on the basic etiquette for participation, such as how to collect ideas, who to contact for support, how to participate in an ongoing discussion, how to contribute to content development and how to review contributions. 
    - Choose a collaborative note-taking platform for recording and communicating decisions, minutes and actions from meetings. (See [the tools section](tools.md) for details of some different note taking platforms.)

- **Think about the timing of your sprint.**
    - You can run the sprint in conjunction with an upcoming event, e.g. a conference/meeting that many in your community will already be engaged with.
    If you would like to attract new contributors, this will make it easier to get people's attention and
    convince them to block time in their calendar to join in with the sprint.
    You may also be able to tap into the promotional communications etc. for that event,
    and/or invite people to join the sprint, e.g. via a lightning talk or poster.
    - Conversely, you may want to avoid clashes with another event if your team is going to be engaged elsewhere or have other commitments.
    - Announce the dates for your sprint at least 6 weeks in advance. 

- **Add dates and time in your calendar**: In addition to the event dates, schedule a few planning meetings with the committee members _before_ the sprint and one meeting/co-working session _after_ the sprint for wrap-up/follow-up tasks.
    - When possible, offer a pre-event onboarding call that can be used for sharing all the relevant resources and setting expectations around what to expect at the event.

- **Scope out what content will be worked on.**
  Defining objectives and which sections/aspects of the lesson should be worked on during the sprint
  will reduce the energy/time required for contributors to begin working and help to keep efforts focused during the event.
  This guidance might be in the form of a list on a shared document or open issues on the lesson repository and do not need to contain much detail.
  You do not need to micromanage individual contributions,
  but a summary of each key objective can serve as a starting point for discussions between collaborators about the best approach to reach those goals.

- **Create a resource for good practices for lesson design.** This resource should be shared with all the participants to assist them in designing lessons to be as effective as possible.
  Consult [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org)
  for recommendations that you and your collaborators will follow when creating the lesson material during the sprint. 

- **Prepare a video call link for all sprint sessions.**
  **[Online]** If your sprint is taking place across multiple sessions,
  or will include multiple video calls between participants, try to provide a single meeting link for them all.
  This will save contributors time when returning to the sprint calls, e.g. for a check-in session or after a break.

- **Use time zone-converted event links for remote participants.**
  **[Online]** For sprints running online with the potential for participants from multiple
  regions/time zones,
  it is vital to announce time(s) and date(s) for your sprint in a way that
  allows visitors to see the equivalent in their local time.
  Always list event timings in UTC and use tools like [timeanddate.com](https://timeanddate.com) to provide an automatic conversion to local time.

- **Promote the sprint widely.** You might want to promote your upcoming sprint to attract contributors beyond your current team.
    - You can use mailing lists, Slack channels, Newsletters, Twitter and direct invitation to reach your desired participant groups.
    - When possible, offer financial support to people who may want to participate but may have special needs to facilitate their participation for the duration of the event (for example, childcare for in-person, high-speed internet for remote events).

- **Prepare a "sprint primer" document and publish it.**
  Provide participants in advance with a single document that provides all the information they need to know before joining (or deciding to join) the sprint:
  what steps do they need to take to register,
  to attend/connect,
  to prepare?
  What can they expect when they join?
  What will the format be?
  What roles will there be within the group?
  In what different ways can participants contribute during the sprint?
  What channels will be used for communication?
  What is the schedule?
  Take everything you have been preparing from the other recommendations in this list and put all that information into this document so your (potential) participants can refer to it before and during the sprint.
  See [this primer document from the CarpentryCon@Home 2020 sprint](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IwnClDjruY9yLmJEUjz-JvRptxqaLsiOTieUlgVbry8/edit?usp=sharing)
  on [the Library Carpentry FAIR Data and Software lesson](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-fair-research/).

There is a number of tools that in combination could be used for running effective curriculum development sprints - we cover a good number of tried and tested technologies under [the tools section](tools.md).

## Recommendations for GitHub

- **Review open issues on your lesson repository** before the sprint
  and consider flagging (labelling) existing issues and opening new ones to describe tasks
  that could be tackled during the event.
  [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards)
  can help with this,
  allowing you to label particular issues within scope for the sprint
  and even organise them further into categories to help contributors find something to work on.
  Even if you cannot invest time into managing issues to this extent,
  make sure open issues include all the contextual information necessary
  for a new or part-time contributor to understand what needs doing
  and whether they can help.
