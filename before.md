# Before the Sprint

- **Create an organising committee for the sprint.** Organising and running the sprint will be much easier if you have some help.
  If possible, create an organising committee of 2+ people responsible for making the sprint happen.
  If you have more than 2-3 people, be sure to assign roles to avoid diffusion of reponsbility.
- **Agree on a code of conduct.** If your lesson repository already has a code of conduct,
  apply it to the sprint and associated events too.
  If your lesson repository does not already have a code of conduct, add one.
  Like licenses, we do not recommend that you write your own code of conduct from scratch.
  Instead, re-use/adapt an existing text you find online.
  We recommend [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html),
  which was designed with exactly these kinds of project in mind.
- **Have a meeting/video call between the committee** to agree on the timing, format,
  target audience in suffient detail and high-level objectives of your sprint,
  establish communications norms, and divide responsibilities. (See below for more details.)
- **Establish communication channels and norms.** How will collaborators communicate before, during, and after the sprint?
    - Dedicated messaging channels have been used with success for conversations/short updates during the sprint and in-between sprint conversations.
    See [During the Sprint](/during.md) for more details.
    - Mailing lists for initial organisation and other important and more permanent communication, e.g. scheduling meetings.
    - Video conferencing technology that is an accessible choice for everyone and suitable for the format of the sprint.
    - Collaborative note taking platform suitable for recording and communicating decisions, minutes and actions from meetings.
- **Read about good practices in lesson design.** To make sure your lesson is as effective as possible,
  consult [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://cdh.carpentries.org)
  and think about how you and your collaborators will follow those recommendations when creating the lesson material during the sprint.
- **Think about the timing of your sprint.**
    - Is there any upcoming event, e.g. a conference/meeting that many in your community will already be engaged with,
    which you could run the sprint in conjunction with?
    - If you would like to attract new contributors, this will make it easier to get people's attention and
    convince them to block time in their calendar to join in with the sprint.
    - You may also be able to tap into the promotional communications etc. for that event,
    and/or invite people to join the sprint, e.g. via a lightning talk or poster.
    - Conversely, you may want to avoid planning the sprint that clashes with another event
    if your team is going to be engaged elsewhere or have other commitments.
- **Consider promoting the sprint.** Generally, you might want to promote your upcoming sprint to attract other contributors.
- **Provide time zone-converted event times for remote participants.**
  For sprints running online with the potential for participants from multiple
  regions/time zones,
  it is vital to announce time(s) and date(s) for your sprint in a way that
  allows visitors to see the equivalent in their local time.
  Using tools like [timeanddate.com](https://timeanddate.com) can make this much easier.
- **Block time in your calendar _after_ the sprint** for wrap-up/follow-up tasks.
- **Create operational guidance for the sprint.**
    - Define roles to make sure everyone is included and gets a chance to contribute, e.g.
        - Sprint facilitator (to make sure discussions are on track)
        - Issue reporter (to make sure all issues/tasks are reported and assigned)
        - Time keeper (to make sure activities are kept to time)
        - Note taker (dedicated and/or everyone)
    - You may choose to rotate the roles during the sprint check-ins.
- **Scope out what content will be worked on.**
  Defining objectives and which sections/aspects of the lesson should be worked on during the sprint
  will reduce the energy/time required for contributors to begin working and help to keep efforts focused during the event.
  This guidance might be in the form of a list on a shared document or open issues on the lesson repository, and do not need to contain much detail.
  You do not need to micromanage individual contributions,
  but a summary of each key objective can serve as a starting point for discussions between collaborators about the best approach to reach those goals.
- **Run a "sprint primer" session.** A primer session helps contributors get oriented with the structure of your lesson and its associated repository,
  the setup required to work on the lesson
  (e.g. local builds to preview lesson webpages),
  and the communication channels that will be used during and in-between the sprint sessions.
- **Prepare a video call link for all sprint sessions.** If your sprint is taking place across multiple sessions,
  or will include multiple video calls between participants, try to provide a single meeting link for them all.
  This will save contributors time when returning to the sprint calls, e.g. for a check-in session or after a break.

There is a number of tools that in combination could be used for running effective curriculum development sprints - we cover a good number of tried and tested technologies under [the tools section](tools.md).

## Recommendations for GitHub

- **Review open issues on your lesson repository** before the sprint
  and consider flagging existing issues and opening new ones to describe tasks
  that could be tackled during the event.
  [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards)
  can help with this,
  allowing you to tag particular issues within scope for the sprint
  and even organise them further into categories to help contributors find something to work on.
  Even if you cannot invest time into managing issues to this extent,
  make sure open issues include all the contextual information necessary
  for a new or part-time contributor to understand what needs doing
  and whether they can help.
- **Consider running a skill-up session for contributors.**
  Depending on their previous experience with the platform,
  contributors may benefit from learning/being reminded how to use GitHub,
  working on branches/forks,
  and the associated tools on their local system.
  Providing a session/resources on this will also make your sprint less
  intimidating for newcomers to lesson development,
  which may increase participation.
  [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) may offer a way for participants to contribute to the lesson
  without the need for setting up a local development environment.
