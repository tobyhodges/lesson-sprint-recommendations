# During the Sprint

- **Enable access to documents for shared note-taking.**
  When possible store all the shareable documents in a central repository or shared drive so they are easy to find.
  One main document should be created to share links to all the resources that will be used for the sprint.
  This document should be kept visible to all participants and persist beyond the end of the sprint.
  
- **Run a "sprint primer" session.** A primer session helps contributors get oriented with the structure of your lesson and its associated repository,
  the setup required to work on the lesson
  (e.g. local builds to preview lesson webpages),
  and the communication channels that will be used during and in-between the sprint sessions.
  You could run this primer session a week or two days before the sprint begins.
  This can also be the first session of the sprint event before co-working sessions begin.

- **Divide co-working sessions with scheduled check-ins** 
  Plan your sprint to have several co-working sessions that are followed by check-ins or report outs to allow contributors to reflect on their progress.
  This will also allow them to share what they've achieved, what's blocking their progress, where they would like some feedback and what they intend to do next.
  We recommend using a web-based shared clock such as [cuckoo.team](https://cuckoo.team/) to keep track of co-working, share-out and breaks.

- **Record information about participants and contributions.**
  - Start your event by asking people to sign-in to the shared document by providing names, [ORCID identifiers](https://orcid.org/), [GitHub usernames](https://github.com), and any other identifiers/handles that can be used to acknowledge their contributions.
  You can also ask you the participant to optionally provide their pronouns to ensure that everyone is addressed with their preferred pronouns.   
  - When working on an online repository, you can use issues to describe and assign tasks.
  This can also be directly done on the shared notes that everyone has access to.
  This helps to avoid duplication of effort during the sprint,
  and gives participants a way of coordinating additional discussions
  among themselves where appropriate to make progress on a task.
  - Prompt participants to add their details to the shared notes,
  so you can refer to it later and ensure everyone's contributions are recorded and proper credit is
  given when publishing the lesson.
  
- **Record the check-ins.**
  If technically possible, and provided all participants consent,
  record these check-ins (video or written) so that those who could not join can catch up
  on the latest progress when they (re-)join the sprint.
  This is particularly important for sprints taking place
  across multiple sessions/days and/or a wide range of time zones.
  These check-in discussions can end by taking extensive notes in the shared document.
  - **Assign roles for check-ins.**
    To ensure everyone has an equal chance to contribute to the discussion
    and the sprint,
    the lead organiser(s) should assign meeting roles for the check-in calls.
    To further promote equity of participation,
    these roles should be rotated for each day of the sprint,
    or each separate sprint event.
    Roles may include:
    - a _Facilitator_ who coordinates the discussion and keeps it moving,
      watching out for raised hands and making sure those with something to contribute
      get the chance to do so;
    - a _Timekeeper_ who monitors the time remaining for the check-in and
      ensures that all topics are covered in a timely fashion.
      The Timekeeper prompts the
      Facilitator/speaker to move on when necessary to cover everything.
    - an _Issue/Task Creator_, who keeps track of actions that arise from the check-in discussion and creates an issue or describes the task in the shared notes.
    - a _Notetaker_, who takes minutes of what is discussed in the check-in.
      In some instances, it may be possible to combine the roles of Notetaker and Task Creator.

- **Use a chat channel for communication outside check-ins.**
  To allow participants to "unplug" from video calls/move to separate locations for the bulk of the sprint,
  use a text-based chat such as Slack or Gitter for discussion when not
  checking in.
  If your chosen platform allows it, minimise global notifications
  to sprint participants by making use of threaded conversations.
  This will allow contributors to focus on their chosen task unless involved in
  a conversation directly relevant to them.

- **Prepare breakout rooms for small group discussion and co-working between check-ins.**
  **[Online]** Open a small number of break out rooms for sprint participants to use during working sessions.
  This allows the participants to self-organize if they need to discuss something they are working on or co-work on a particular task.
  In Zoom, select the option to "Let participants choose room".
  For **[in-person]** sprints, prepare an equivalent set of different rooms/locations
  for participants to gather and discuss in smaller groups without fear of
  disturbing the whole team.

- **Provide a way for contributors to mark their work ready for review.**
  If you prefer to require material is reviewed before being included in the lesson,
  give participants a way to signal when their contributions are ready.
  You might consider providing guidance/assigning responsibility for reviewers
  of particular sections/types of contribution.
  If your lesson is being developed on GitHub, see the section below for more
  specific recommendations.

- **Reviewing contributions.**
  Allocate 1-2 sessions in the sprint to review and approve contributions made by others.
  If this is not planned in the event, sprints may end with an influx of new material as contributors finish up what they were working on as the event closed.
  Make sure that each contribution is reviewed and if possible (and where appropriate), merged into the lesson. 
  This allows contributors to leave the event with a sense of accomplishment from the sprint,
  and ties up any loose ends before new tasks are taken on to develop the material further.
  If the participants who were originally assigned to review have had to leave before the review session,
  the organisers should delegate the review task to those who are available and willing to help finish the review process on time.
  
- **Ask for feedback.**
  Allocate a short feedback session before closing the event.
  Feedback should be kept short and recorded anonymously via a feedback form or shared document (that does not require signing in).
  Ask your participants to reflect on the event in terms of what worked and what can be improved.

## Recommendations for GitHub

- **Consider running a skill-up session for contributors.**
  Depending on their previous experience with the platform,
  contributors may benefit from learning/being reminded how to use GitHub,
  working on branches/forks,
  and the associated tools on their local system.
  Providing a session/resources on this will also make your sprint less
  intimidating for newcomers to lesson development,
  which may increase participation.
  [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) may offer a way for participants to contribute to the lesson
  without the need for setting up a local development environment.
  As with the "primer" session mentioned above,
  this skill-up may fit best at the beginning of the sprint.
  This can also run as a separate event
  that takes place in the days leading up to the full sprint.

- **Flag pull requests as a draft and ready for review as you work.**
  Opening draft pull requests early, while work on a task is ongoing,
  can help contributors understand where progress is being made and identify
  tasks/issues that still need to be tackled.
  Marking pull requests as ready for review helps maintainers prioritise their
  focus during the sprint and maintains momentum by ensuring that completed work
  is merged into the lesson as soon as possible.
  Opening draft pull requests is particularly important at the end of a sprint,
  to capture progress up to that point even if a task hasn't yet been completed.

- **Plan who will review pull requests.**
  Make a plan for who will review each pull request (PR).
  As a group, you can create a list of reviewers by subject so the person who opens the pull request knows who is interested and capable of reviewing and can request a review accordingly.
  Alternatively, you may decide on a circle of reviewers. E.g. Aaliyah reviews Juan's PRs, Juan reviews Alex's PRs, and Alex reviews Aaliyah's PRs.
  Another option might be to ask for a reviewer when planning who will do the task.
  For particularly small groups where reviewing is more likely to become a bottleneck, or in cases where the main objective of the sprint is to create quantity rather than quality, you may decide it is acceptable for contributors to merge their own pull requests.

- **Link pull requests to open issues.**
  Mentioning open issues in pull requests (even when a work in progress)
  informs people about which issues are being worked on.
  As mentioned in the point above, this is particularly useful to ensure progress
  can continue on the lesson after the sprint has finished.

- **Record contributions that do not (directly) result in commits.**
  Some participants may be more comfortable writing material on a different platform
  e.g. Google Docs, which is later transferred to GitHub by someone else.
  Make use of GitHub's [commit co-author](https://github.blog/2018-01-29-commit-together-with-co-authors/) feature where possible or,
  if the author does not have a GitHub account,
  make sure their name and other details are included in your README, AUTHORS,
  or any other listing/metadata about contributors to the project
  (`.zenodo.json`, `.allcontributorsrc`, etc).

- **Review open pull requests.**
  At the end of the sprint, organisers should ensure that any pull requests marked as ready for review are processed and (where appropriate) merged,
  so that these contributions are not forgotten or left to go stale before changes can be requested.
