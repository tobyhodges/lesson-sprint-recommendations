# After the Sprint

- **Celebrate the progress.**
  Though lesson development is an iterative process, every contribution counts towards the completion of a lesson. 
  It is, therefore, important to celebrate the progress you and your colleagues make at the lesson development sprint.
  Take a break (if you can) before meeting the organising committee for a debrief call.
 
- **List completed and outstanding tasks.**
  Create GitHub issues or share a document to highlight the status of different tasks.
  Set a deadline for the completion of outstanding tasks to share online with all the contributors.
  These will help you and other contributors understand the next steps when working together on the lesson as well as continue working on the lesson asynchronously.
  
- **Plan the next steps!**
    Review the shared documents from the sprint and highlight successes and place for improvements to include in a report.
    Feedback and reflections from running a sprint often inform a new set of changes and updates to be made in the event format or lesson material, discuss and document those for planning the next events.
  Plan to host a periodic co-working call to keep collaborators engaged or schedule the next sprint to
  ensure that momentum is maintained on the lesson.

- **Write up a report and share it with your contributors.**
  A summary of progress made and next steps (with links to open issues/work-in-progress pull requests)
  will help you and your contributors appreciate the progress made during your sprint,
  and encourage efforts on the lesson to continue.
  Consider turning this overview into a blog post to share your experience and achievements with the wider community!

- **Contribute to these recommendations.**
  While organising and running your sprint, did you find any useful resources or steps not already covered
  in this guide?

  or contribute your changes directly in a [new pull request](https://github.com/tobyhodges/lesson-sprint-recommendations/pulls).

## Recommendations for GitHub

- **Capture outstanding tasks in new issues on the lesson repository.**
  You may also wish to assign these to specific contributors for follow up after the sprint.

- **Label issues to encourage asynchronous contributions.**
  Issue labels, such as "help-wanted" and "good-first-issue," provide valuable information to potential contributors
  about where their contributions could be most valuable and how they could begin to get involved with developing
  your lesson.
  Issues labelled "good first issue" will appear automatically on the `/contribute` page of your repository,
  providing a quick overview of ways to get involved that have a low barrier for entry.
  Other labels can be used in a similar way to automatically display listings of issues to potential contributors.
  For example, The Carpentries publishes [a Help Wanted page](https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/) that provides their community with an overview of
  open issues with the "help-wanted" label on many of their repositories.

- **Clean up branches on your repository.**
  Sprints often leave behind a large number of merged branches that can be removed from the lesson repository.
  Minimising the number of "stale" branches reduces clutter on your repository, allows contributors to name their branches without fear of an unintentional clash
  and helps people working with local branches.
